    2. Turns out there was a mistake and toilet paper was actually paper towels. Make the appropriate update.
    3. Sanitizer sells out. Remove it from the list.
    4. Business is so good the company launches a new product: Bleach. Add it to the list.
    
    Note: After creating the initial array do not just create a brand new array. Modify it accordingly.
